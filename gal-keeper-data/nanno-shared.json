However, the land is now ruled by the demons who had conspired against and successfully defeated the goddess.\n\nThe 4 queens who rule over their respective domains have long maintained a pact of non-intervention. However, one day, after receiving reports that the Dark Empress Karvia was engaging in suspicious activity, the other 3 queens simultaneously declared war on her.\n\nDespite being surrounded on all sides by enemies, the Demon Empress Karvia was confident that she would prevail. After all, she had under her command a secret task force unit, one that served her well during the battle for Helvetia against the goddess, and is also the unit that she considers to have been the deciding factor in the war...The 'Black Arme Vapula'.\n\nThe unit shrouded in darkness and stricken from history, led by the war hero and our protagonist, Leonhardt...Setting foot onto the stage known as the battlefield once again, the flames of ambition burn brightly within him.\n\n[From [url=http://www.ninetail.tk/tde12/VenusBloodHOLLOW_en18.html]Official site[/url]]",

      "description": "Elves are smart, long-lived, and attuned to the wind. Wips can manipulate flame. Segitts have incredible muscular strength. Somehow, humans have learned to survive. In the racially-diverse technopolis of the Seventh Republic, they even dominate.\nOut of all the strange and terrible corners of the world, at least humans can feel safe in this one. Here, there’s strength in numbers. Within this country's peacekeeping police force lies a special 13th Division reserved for the troublemakers, eccentrics, and other such unorthodox individuals of the organization. \n\nOne human, though? Pitifully outclassed against a single member of almost any other race; it’d never be a fair fight—unless that human was a Keeper or carrying some serious Class A police tech. But tech can be stolen, and far from all Keepers are on the side of justice. \nStrict border checks. Pervasive, draconian surveillance, with camera eyes and a computerized spine running signals to the heart of the NPA, the National Police Agency. And the physical hands of this digital dragon? The police themselves. Sometimes the hands of justice grip too tight.\nSo how’s a nation supposed to keep the peace?\n\nAmong this police force, one division dares to stand against the current. One division dares to disobey orders, break regulations, refuse to work overtime, and generally make themselves useless to everyone, especially their bosses, except for people in need. That is our protagonist Hiryuu Ruka. \nDespite his outstanding capabilities as an officer, his problematic demeanor and obsession with the events that sparked a past tragedy invited the ire of the upper management and landed him where he is now: the 13th Division of the NPA. The Sideliners.\n\nRuka prefers to work alone, but the addition of an Elf by the name of Claris to the division put an end to his lone-wolf work style as he was made to pair up with the fresh-out-of-police-school newcomer. As Ruka spends his days bickering with the incompetent newcomer and his incompetent superiors, he rescues a girl who's come to the Seventh Republic in seek of refuge, setting in motion events that would change his life forever.\n\n[Translated from the [url=http://world-actor.com/index.html#story-anker/]official website[/url] and [url=https://shiravune.com/archives/368]Shiravune[/url]]",

      "description": "One day, a very ordinary boy named Kouki was enveloped by a bright light and found himself in a new world. It was an unfamiliar place with a school that floated in the sky. Yes, this was not the normal world that he knew, but rather a magical world where magic ability determines one’s place in society. He met Akina, who looked very much like a girl he admired, and she took him in as a servant at the school where the elite magicians attended. He wondered how he would survive in this world without any magic ability. However, the general magic competition known as ‘Rave’, would be the fateful event that would enable him to forge bonds.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2019/01/01/january-2019-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri~![/url]]",

      "description": "[i][b]Let's soar together again—aiming high with love, creativity, and youth――――[/b][/i]\n\nStarting this year, Kagami Toshiki is packing bags and moving into his cousin's house in Tokyo. And Toshiki's got a mission in mind rather than just a change of address: to get his creative mojo back, reignite that spark he once had.\n\nBack in the day, Toshiki had a childhood best friend named Ayase Aisa.\nThey were two peas in a pod, constantly pushing each other to be their best regarding their creative pursuits. However, as time passed, Toshiki increasingly felt they were on different pages. Later on, Aisa moved to Tokyo due to family circumstances.\n\nEven though they were miles apart, Toshiki and Aisa kept in touch by sending letters about their lives and exchanging the novels they had written. However, when Aisa started school, she suddenly ghosted Toshiki, completely cutting off communication without explanation and leaving him in the dark.\n\nNonetheless, Toshiki wasn't about to throw in the towel on his creative hustle. He kept grinding, making indie games, and even hitting it big with his first published light novel.\n\nToshiki was on a roll, levelling up as a creator, but about half a year ago, something knocked him off his game. He found himself stuck with the writer's block. Then it hit him - maybe if he surrounded himself with other creators his age, it could be the spark he needed to regain his mojo. That's when he set his sights on Saika Academy, a private school in Tokyo that brings together creators from diverse fields.\n\nAs spring arrived, Toshiki successfully passed the entrance exam for Saika Academy. He moved to Tokyo, ready to start this new chapter. \n\nBut then, in a twist of fate, Toshiki unexpectedly bumped into Aisa, his long-lost childhood friend, in the city's heart.\n\n[Translated and edited from the [url=http://ainolinks.com/]official website[/url]]",

The lone wolf Eishi and his bizarre imouto Yuura and polite and kind childhood friend Sayo each have their own problems, as is the case with the hero-admiring kouhai Yurugi and cool Kukuri, who he found stuffed in a trash can in an alleyway. Various events and expectations were waiting ahead for these individuals with wounded hearts, such as playing concentration with the club room on the line, playing old maid with a girl who had been cast off, making up for what has been lost while watching the fireworks with fascination.\n\nDespite his disposition, Eishi vowed to bring a happy end for everyone. One where everyone would be able to smile. He would do it in his own way, working hard to attain an uncertain goal. This is the beginning of a story about growing up in a city where tears have been lost.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/march-2017-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochiakeri![/url]]",

Become soldiers for endless wars. With men branded savage and cast aside, society blooms into a maiden's utopia - of women, by women, for women!\n\nYet one boy walks this twisted utopia in secret.\n\nOnce a Defense Force cadet, he slipped through the cracks to a quiet, remote village life, forged papers hiding him with his adoptive mother and sister. Until \"Mother\" - the AI-running society - summons him to the Security Force training school.\n\nHis adoptive sister volunteers to follow, and together, they step into the city - still a dazzling garden despite its decay.\nMasquerading at the all-girls academy, he finds himself rooming with Akari, whose gentle heart knows no guile. Between tough training and watchful seniors, something deeper than friendship takes root.\n\nBut in a world that hunts men like wolves, where extremists howl for male extinction, there's no telling what horrors await if his secret slips.\n\nAfter all, even sweet Akari declares: \"My dream is to exterminate all men!\"\n \n[Translated and edited from [url=https://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=1282568]Getchu[/url]]",
